<h2>Capture the Point!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Two players fight for control of an objective.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to have fun competing against one another, and also to enjoy the tug-of-war style gameplay with simple to learn casual controls.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
The game is most similar to a fighting game.
=======
<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.

Players control one of two characters with the arrow keys and WASD keys. The goal of the gameplay is to accumlate points by standing on the point. Players can force one another back to thier intial spawn point by jumping and pressing their down key to land on the other player. I initially planned to make the gameplay focus on aerial movement either through a flight mechanic or removing left and right ground movement. I decided not to prototype these mechanics as I am still learning the features of Phaser. Other core gameplay features not included in the prototype are the following: unique characters, playing to certain number of points, random events, and rounds of play.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of this prototype was to test the base capture-point gameplay. While the ability to fight the other players is included, it is not the focus of the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game includes gameplay similar to fighting games, but does not use hit points. Instead, gameplay revolves around gaining control of an objective, similar to a shooting game.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is currently an abstraction of two fighters trying to gain control of a power artifact.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Two fighters are fighting for control of a powerful artifact.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target demographic would probably be around ages 10+.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
There is currently no win condition, but playing first to 1000 points takes 2-5 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
It can be more effective to move off the point for a moment to stop the enemy's approach than to try and hold your ground at all costs.
    
Try luring an opponent into a game of chicken. Follow them as high as you can and see if they try to dive down too early.
    
Use short hops by tapping up, left/right, down. This allows for movement while staying on the offensive.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Prototype sprites were made from scratch.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The gameplay is similar to mechanics in the game DiveKick. The game itself was derived from the included Phaser tutorial.
=======
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story, summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

How long does your game take to play?
</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing from a Phaser Example, you must say so here.
